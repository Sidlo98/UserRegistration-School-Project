# UserRegistration-School-Project
First Assignment i javascript-1

In this assignment, you will create a website using HTML, CSS and JS that handle users. You can use css libraries such as Bootstrap and MDBootstrap if you want to make the page more attractive. You can also use Bootstrap's various components if you wish.

 

To pass approved, do the following:

Create a form that registers and saves user information in a list when you press a button. the submit part of the form must be done using a javascript.

The user information must be:
id (this should be auto-generated and not specified by the user)
first name
last name
email address

The user information must be validated before being saved in a list. If the information does not contain the correct information such as that a field is empty or contains too few characters, the field in the form must be formatted so that the user is made aware of this. Also keep in mind that the email address should not contain special characters such as åäö. You have to solve this ..

A text must also be printed out informing what errors have occurred in the form.

When the form has been validated and approved, this should be saved in a list and then the list should be displayed on the page. For each user listed, information such as the full name and email address should be displayed, of which the email address should be in a smaller size and displayed under the full name:

To pass well approved, you must do the following:

It must be possible to change a user's information. When you press the change button, the information of the current user must be displayed in the fields in the form and when you press the save button, the information must be updated. Note that the user's position in the list should not be changed, it should retain the position it was originally given.

It must be possible to remove a user from the list.

It should not be possible to enter user information that already exists. Each e-mail address that is in the list must therefore be unique.
